# Torment of C

A web ape dives into the inhospitable lands of C. Besieged by pointers and tormented by stories of memory leaks, chars, long longs,
In an attempt to expand his low-level knowledge, this web-ape javascript brrr, will face the infamous _Torment of C_ (a macabre version of the _Advent of code_)
where he'll either die trying or from whom it'll blossom a low-level badass gorilla.

Jokes aside, programming is fun and I feel like torturing myself with C could be a great exercise to take me out of my comfort zone (mostly web technologies).
My goal is to become more familiar with how resources work and get a better grasp of how my beloved technologies work under the hood.
I got some basic notions but most of it will feel like dark magic. I'll try drawing some conclusions for each day and part.

This is going to take ages.

## Day 1

* Use man-pages to lookup function explanations. E.g. `man fseek` will display info about fseek function.

## Day 2

* Managing memory is absolutely harder than I assumed. Makes you appreciate the wondrous data structures provided in higher level languages.
